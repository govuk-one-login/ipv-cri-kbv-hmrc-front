  h1: Answer some security questions
  content:
    - We use security questions as the last step in checking your identity.
    - The questions are about information that's personal to you. This stops other people from pretending to be you.
    - You must answer enough questions correctly to prove your identity. You can then continue to the service you need to use.
    - "## Before you start"
    - "You'll need some of these documents:"
    - - payslips
      - P60
      - Self Assessment tax return
      - tax credits
    - This is because the questions use information from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
